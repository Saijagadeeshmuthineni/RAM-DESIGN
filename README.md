It’s called “random access” because the computer can access any part of the memory directly and quickly. RAM (Random Access Memory) is very similar to memory in the Human Brain. The human brain’s memory is the most essential part played by the brain. Memory helps in remembering things, and people remember their past due to the memory present in the brain, similarly, computers have memory too. RAM helps your computer run programs and process information quickly. When you turn off your computer, the data in RAM is lost, unlike data on your hard drive which is stored permanently.
